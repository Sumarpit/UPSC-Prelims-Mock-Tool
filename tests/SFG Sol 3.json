Under Articles 2 and 3  of the Constitution, Parliament has the authority to form new States , \nalter the boundaries , and even rename existing State s.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Option c is the correct answe r.  \nFiscal federalism refers to the financial arrangements between different levels of government.  It involves how \nrevenue powers, expenditure responsibilities, and fiscal autonomy are distributed. In India, the concept of fiscal \nfederalism did not emerge overnight; rather, it evolved gradually through various constitutional enactments passed \nduring British rule.  \nOption c is correct . The Government of India Act, 1919  (Montagu -Chelmsford Reforms) was a landmark in the \nevolution of fiscal federalism  in India. For the first time , it introduced a clear -cut separation of revenue heads  \nbetween the Centre and the Provincial governments. This meant that certain sources of revenue (like customs, \nincome tax, and central excise) were reserved exclusively for the Centre , while others (like land revenue, irrigation, \nand local taxes) were assigned to the Provinces. This division was a necessary step to operationalize the \u201cDyarchy\u201d \nsystem, under which certain subjects were transferred to Indian ministers in the provinces. T hus, the Government of \nIndia Act, 1919  is regarded as the foundation stone of fiscal federalism in India . \nKnowledge Base:  \nThe Government of India Act, 1935  further strengthened financial federalism by making provisions for revenue \nsharing  and grants -in-aid between the Centre and the Provinces. However, it did not introduce  the concept of \n\n \n \n  \n \n \nseparation; it merely refined and expanded  the framework that the 1919 Act had already established. Therefore, while \nthe 1935 Act was important for developing the federal structure, the credit for initiating financial division goes to the \n1919 Act.",

    "explanation": "The Consolidated Fund of India (CFI)  is the primary account into which all government revenues are deposited. \nCertain key constitutional authorities have their salaries and related expenses charged on the CFI , which means these \nexpenditure s are non-votable by Parliament .

According to Article 112(3)(e)  the salary, allowances and pension payable to or in respect of t he \nComptroller and Auditor -General of India are charged on consolidated funds of India.  \nThis protection is also provided under Article 148(6)  of the Constitution of India.

Therefore, the CAG must remain completely free from any form of executive or legislative pressure.  \nOption II is correct . The salaries and pensions of the UPSC Chairperson and Members are charge d on the \nConsolidated Fund of India . This protection appears under Article 322 , which states that the expenses of the UPSC, \nincluding salaries, shall be charged on the CFI. This helps maintain the neutrality of the Commission in matters of \nrecruitment.  \nOption III is incorrect . The NCW is a statutory body created under the National Commission for Women Act, 1990 . \nSection 5(4) of this Act states that the salaries and allowances of the Chairperson and Members shall be paid out of \nthe grants  made by the Central  Government.

    "explanation": "In a symmetric federal system , all constituent units of the federation enjoy equal powers and status under the \nConstitution, with no distinction among them. In contrast, asymmetric federalism  refers to a system in which \ndifferent units of the federation possess unequal powers  and varying degrees in political, administrative, or fiscal \nmatters.  \nIndian Constitution also incorporates several asymmetric features  by granting special power s, privileges, or \nrepresentation to certain states and regions based on their distinct historical, ethnic, or geographical circumstances.  \nOption I is incorrect: Second Schedule  \n\u25cf The Second Schedule deals with the salaries, allowances, and emoluments of con stitutional authorities  such as \nthe President, Governors, Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts.  \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\u25cf It is purely administrative and has no bearing on the federal structure. Hence, it does not reflect asymmetry in \nfederal relations.  \nOption II is correct:  Fourth Schedule  \n\u25cf The Fourth Schedule deals with the allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha  (Council of States).  \n\u25cf The allocation is not equal for all states ; it is based primarily on population, giving larger states greater \nrepresentation. Larger states like Ut tar Pradesh have 31 members, while smaller ones like Sikkim have only 1.  \n\u25cf This unequal representation is another expression of asymmetry , as not all states have the same weight in the \nfederal chamber.  \nOption III is correct: The Fifth Schedule (Articles 244( 1)) applies to certain states (except the four states of Assam, \nMeghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram) which have Scheduled Areas inhabited by Scheduled Tribes. It provides a special \nadministrative framework for governance  in these areas. \n\u25cf It empowers the Governor  to make regulations for peace and good governance in these areas and establishes a \nTribes Advisory Council  to safeguard the interests of Scheduled Tribes.  \n\u25cf Hence, these states enjoy special constitutional arrangements not available to others, a clear inst ance of \nasymmetrical federalism.  \nOption IV is correct: The Sixth Schedule (Articles 244(2) and 275(1))  applies to the Northeastern states: Assam, \nMeghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram . \n\u25cf It provides for the creation of Autonomous District and Regional Councils  with legislative, executive, and judicial \npowers. These councils can make laws on land, forests, and local customs.  \n\u25cf Thus, the Sixth Schedule  is a strong example of constitutional and legislative asymmetry .",
